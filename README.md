# Car-sharing-blockchain

## Description

The Car Sharing Blockchain project is a beginner-friendly application that demonstrates the use of blockchain technology for car-sharing services. This project provides a simple interface for users to securely share and access vehicles, ensuring that all transactions are transparent and tamper-proof. The application is designed for those new to blockchain and aims to provide a foundational understanding of how decentralized applications can function in real-world scenarios.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main file to run the Car Sharing application.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages to install.
- `blockchain/`: Directory containing the blockchain logic and smart contracts.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have **Python** installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Itâ€™s recommended to use **virtualenv** or **conda** for managing dependencies.

### Installing Dependencies

1. If you're using `virtualenv`, create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the Car Sharing application, run the following command:
```bash
python app.py
Once the application is running, you can access the car-sharing features through your web browser.

Features
Secure Transactions: All car-sharing transactions are recorded on a blockchain, ensuring security and transparency.
User Management: Users can register, log in, and manage their car-sharing preferences.
Car Availability: View available cars for sharing and request access.
Troubleshooting
Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed.
If you encounter issues when running the application, check for error messages in the console for guidance.
